### PVS Library Manager


A tool for managing PVS libraries featuring support for different library sources, libraries with several theories, and dependencies among theories. The tool, freely available for download, is a command line application written in the Python programming language and depends, mainly, on the distributed revision control system git.

The current distribution of pvslm automatically installs the latest version of the NASA PVS Library, a collection of formal PVS developments maintained by the NASA Langley Formal Methods Team.
